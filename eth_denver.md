# ðŸ§± DARC-SPICE development at ETH Denver 2022

Below are short summaries of the ways to get involved in DARC-SPICE at ETH Denver.

## cadCAD simulations

All DARC-SPICE simulations are currently running in TokenSPICE. To make DARC-SPICE more accessible, it should offer both TokenSPICE and cadCAD simulations. If you have experience with cadCAD or want to learn, one way to get involved is by recreating the current simulations in the DARC-SPICE repo in cadCAD. For more information on how the simulations are currently implemented, see [this blog post](https://pulse.opsci.io/technical-excursions-on-simulations-for-science-token-communities-4f21113262dc).

## Baseline model development

Currently, DARC-SPICE comes with a number of modular DeSci models, however, only one baseline model. If youâ€™re interested in contributing to DARC-SPICE, consider developing new baseline models that match real-world funding data (e.g. from the NIH, NSF, or other agencies).

## Frontend development

One of the goals of DARC-SPICE is making science token engineering as accessible as possible and one way to do that is creating an interactive UI for easily running simulations. Areas to contribute:

- design/frontend
- backend

## Documentation

If you want to learn more about the different aspects of Web3 and token engineering, you can contribute to the [DARC-SPICE documentation](https://opscientia.gitbook.io/darc-spice/). Things to do include:
- Going through the guides and make corrections/additions if something is unclear
- Adding content to Concepts section

## Content Writing / Research

If you want to get into the theoretical part of Science Token Engineering, we welcome any contributions in the form of blog posts / list of resources that would help others on their journey to STE. To submit a blog post, head on over to hack.opsci.io and share your draft as a new topic, make sure to include the #hackathon tag. Alternatively, add any resources you come across to the RESOURCES.md file in the DARC-SPICE repo.
